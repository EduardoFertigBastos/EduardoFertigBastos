### Hey, I'm Eduardo Fertig Bastos ðŸ‘Œ

Hello! I'm Eduardo Fertig Bastos, a Senior Software Engineer with 5 years of experience and a degree in Information Systems from UNIDAVI (2019-2022).

In the front-end realm, I feel right at home using Next.js and React JS, but I've also had considerable experience with Vue 3, Angular, vanilla JavaScript, and JQuery. When it comes to the back-end, I find my comfort zone with Node.js, Laravel, and, not least, vanilla PHP. Regarding databases, my preference leans towards PostgreSQL and MongoDB, but I've also gained significant experience with MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server.

Technologies like these that helped me build my freelance work such as "Anonymous Internal Assessment System" where an institution can register forms for its employees and community to respond anonymously and "Points for Special Diet People" which helps people with special diets find establishments commercials that sell specific products for these people, whether celiac (like me ðŸ¤—), lactose intolerant or others.

Beyond the lines of code, I believe in the power of soft skills. I advocate for effective communication, teamwork, and I highly value empathy. With a sprinkle of constant curiosity, I am eager to contribute to projects that truly make a difference.
