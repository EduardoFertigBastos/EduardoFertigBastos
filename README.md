### Hey, I'm Eduardo Fertig Bastos ðŸ‘Œ

<p>
   Hello! I'm Eduardo Fertig Bastos, a Full-Stack developer with 5 years of experience and a degree in Information Systems from UNIDAVI (2019-2022). 
</p>
<p>
   In the front-end realm, I feel right at home using Next.js and React JS, but I've also had considerable experience with Vue 3, Angular, vanilla JavaScript, and JQuery. When it comes to the back-end, I find my comfort zone with Node.js, Laravel, and, not least, vanilla PHP. Regarding databases, my preference leans towards PostgreSQL, but I've also gained significant experience with MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, and MongoDB. Beyond the lines of code, I believe in the power of soft skills. I advocate for effective communication, teamwork, and I highly value empathy. With a sprinkle of constant curiosity, I am eager to contribute to projects that truly make a difference.
